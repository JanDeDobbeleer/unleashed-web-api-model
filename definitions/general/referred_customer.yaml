type: object
title: Referred customer object
description: |
  Sometimes you want to refer to another customer. Within the context this can be the most logic to do by e-mail,
  customer code or msisdn. With this object you must pass one and exactly one of those identifiers.
  Also important this identifier should uniquely identify a customer. E.g. in some context an e-mail can be used by
  multiple customers, so this is not a good identifier in that context.
