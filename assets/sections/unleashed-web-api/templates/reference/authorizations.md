A user can either own a SIM card or have authorization to a SIM card. 
When a user has authorization to a SIM card, he has access to almost all information regarding that SIM, 
he's just not the owner of it. 
The owner of the SIM card is able to remove the authorised user without acceptance of that authorised user.

Some things an authorised user can do:

* See the remaining credit, bundles, ...
* See the topup history
* See the usage history
* See the invoices
* Do topups / pay invoices (But not with the Viking Points or the easy payment method of the owner, you have to pay it with your own resources)
* See settings, like SIM card information (PIN, PUK, ...)

As you see, the idea is that on an authorised SIM, you can only see things, but not change them. So things an authorised user can't do with the SIM:

* Mark the SIM as lost or stolen
* Change voicemail settings
* Change notification settings
* Change SIM alias
* Migrate between postpaid and prepaid (or vice versa)
* If it's a postpaid SIM, change the price plan
* Order another SIM for the owner of the authorised SIM
