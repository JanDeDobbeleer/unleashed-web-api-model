        Pass an optional filter on type. E.g. `type=subscription` would give all the products that are a subscription,
        `type=subscription\postpaid` would give all products that are postpaid subscriptions. You should always give the
        full-type, so `type=postpaid` will not work.
        Note you can define multiple types and then the union will be returned.
